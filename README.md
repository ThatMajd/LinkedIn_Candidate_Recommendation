## Overview

The "Candidate Locator" project introduces an advanced solution to streamline candidate selection processes within organizations. By harnessing machine learning techniques, particularly regression modeling, alongside thorough data collection and processing methods, the project aims to optimize recruitment efforts and identify optimal candidates for specific roles.

At its core, the project employs a model capable of predicting the tenure of candidates based on their skills and job requirements. This model takes inputs such as the "meta_industry" and a job "prompt" to extract skill requirements and match them with candidate profiles. Through rigorous data collection and training, the model provides insights into which candidates are likely to stay longest within the company.

By automating candidate selection and tenure prediction, the "Candidate Locator" project offers a data-driven approach to hiring, promising enhanced efficiency and informed decision-making for organizations seeking to secure top talent.
