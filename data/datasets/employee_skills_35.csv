Through this new knowledge I’m obtaining I plan to become a Software Developer and begin video game development or implant my ideas in new technology such as Virtual or Augmented Reality. With that type of degree and goals set in mind I believe my past leadership experiences such as being Class President in high school and being a member of three national accredited organizations will help me in my near future. Along with my academic achievements graduating in my top ten percent of my class, while completing the requirements of the Distinguished Academic Program (DAP) puts confidence in my abilities to persevere through any situation and finish any task with a hundred and top percent.

josiah-gilbert,"I'm Master's student studying Statistics at Virginia Tech, eager to apply my statistical and programming skills to real-world problems. I received my B.S. in Statistics from CalPoly, San Luis Obispo in 2022. Rather than an esoteric, purely abstract discipline, I see statistics as fundamentally grounded in the real world. It's the quantification of uncertainty to enable decision-making in an uncertain world. This focus on drawing useful conclusions in the face of limited knowledge is what sets statistics apart from pure mathematics. And this is also what draws me to statistics. More than anything else, I'm fascinated by statistics' ability to make insights and solve real-world problems based on limited knowledge. In my problem-solving approach I emphasize understanding the real-world context of problems to produce informed and relevant analyses grounded in . Too often problems are approached with a detached, ""plug-and-chug"" attitude which leads to oversights and suboptimal solutions. I strive to avoid this by taking the time to listen carefully, ask questions and gain a broader understanding of the problem before crafting an analysis. And if we are honest, statistics is inherently application, if you have no interest in working to understand the context of the problem are you really doing statistics?

aaron-fielden-317945208,"I have worked in the air quality industry since I have graduated from Tennessee Tech University. I have been very fortunate to have great training and leadership along the way. The testing and mitigation of Radon, a Radioactive gas, was my foot in the door to the air quality industry, but I soon made the switch to Radiation Safety to try and broaden my horizons. At energy solutions, I made a name for myself for being a hard worker, and getting things done for the operations side of business in a timely fashion. I have worked with most radioactive isotopes the we received to reduce their volume, and send to burial in Utah. I have worked with High Radiation materials, and High contamination materials, and am completely comfortable with that type of work. It is a nasty field of work and deserves much respect by the worker, but with the right ALARA precautions and safety controls, it can be a somewhat safe work environment too. I then took a job at Oak Ridge National Lab as an Environmental Sampling Tech, where I mostly focus on radioactive stack ventilation sampling. I do have some experience with radioactive water sampling, chlorine water sampling, and heavy metals water sampling as well. On a typical day, I climb to the 50' level of the stacks to retrieve our sampling media, break it down in our lab hood, and turn it in to our analytical team for analysis. Our process also involves velocity measurements, each quarter, of the air flowing in the stack. We use various pitot tubes to achieve those results. Working at heights everyday requires much training, so I am actually rope rescue certified as well. We are put through various rope rescues with a dummy suspended in air throughout the year to maintain these qualifications.

baileylparker,"My interest in the profession of pharmacy began in high school at a career day in my Junior year when I had the opportunity to listen to a pharmacist from a local hospital speak about her job. I always had an interest in the medical field but was never sure of what I actually wanted to do but the way she described her job and getting to improve her patient’s quality of life definitely sparked my interest of pharmacy. Keeping pharmacy in in my mind, I went on to graduate with my AA degree a week before I graduated from high school and a couple of months later went off to undergrad. I started on the pre-med track and once I did more research on the pharmacy profession, I quickly focused my classes more towards pre-pharmacy. My sophomore year of undergrad I began working at Publix Pharmacy as a Pharmacy Technician. I really wanted to start working in the pharmacy to lay a foundation for my pharmacy path but I quickly learned that although there are a lot of skills and processes that are taught in the pharmacy there were also skills that I have always had and could really put to use while being a pharmacy tech, intern, and eventually pharmacist. Working in the pharmacy has shown me that although medications do improve patient’s quality of life it is just as important to take the time to show empathy, take the time to answer questions, and educate patients about their medications and disease state. It is easy to get caught up in the tasks that have to be done but I’ve found that taking your time to communicate to patients and the people around you is extremely important and is something I genuinely value. I look forward to using my leadership skills and determination to make my career as a pharmacist successful and meaningful. As a pharmacy intern now and in my 3rd year of pharmacy school I look forward to not only expanding my education and soon getting to put it to practice but continuing to grow in my communication, empathy, patient care, and leadership. I am on track to graduate with my PharmD in 2024 and am eager to make this dream career as a pharmacist a reality.

Using my analytical skills, I love to help building products that have positive impact on the lives of others. I am also very much interested in classical music.

He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he's always doing both."" ― James A. Michener ""Whatever happened, it happened for good. What is happening, is also happening for good. Whatever will happen, that too will be for good. What have you lost for which you weep? What did you bring with you, which you have lost? What did you produce, which has perished? You did not bring anything when you were born. You came empty and you will go the same way. Whatever is yours today, it was somebody else's yesterday, And it will be somebody else's tomorrow. The change is the law of universe."" ― Bhagavad Gita

(Also, I like my wife and accepting one of those positions would involve weeks at a time away from home.) In early 2012 I formed OnPoint R&C, LLC and began doing research and drafting for a Tx surveyor (Carlson Suvrvey 2012 software). After two and a half years of sitting around and working behind a computer drafting part time, getting fat and lazy! I have recently taken a position as Maintenance Director for a long term care facility (nursing home) that's keeping me quite busy. Proud to note that my cholesterol level is back down, my BP is spot on normal and I've lost the extra 15 lbs. I'd gained. And still drafting part-time too.

I like to think of Private Banking as a concierge service that caters to busy professionals that need the highest level of personal attention from a banker. As a Private Banker, you can reach me or a member of my team 24/7. You will never call an 800 number and go through a recording to speak with us. • Need a business line of credit? I can do that. • How about a personal or business checking account? I got you covered. • Looking to purchase a commercial property and need financing? I can definitely do that. • Need a Home Equity Line of Credit to help fund the outrageous kitchen makeover you saw on HGTV? Yep, I can do that too. These are just a few examples of the services I can provide as your banking relationship manager. I also work in tandem with other TowneBank Specialists to help meet ALL your financial planning needs. Everything from insurance to mortgages to investments and beyond. So can anybody have a Private Banker or is there some special requirement? That is the 2nd most popular question I get asked. While Private Banking does have special programs for physicians and attorneys, we also have programs for business owners and other executives as well. So are you getting concierge service from your banker?? I’d love to talk to you and see how I can make your life easier and your business more successful. Samantha.Sully@townebank.net

ormondaa,"I ❤️ building brands! I've driven positive change for iconic brands like Harley-Davidson, Coors Light, and Porsche. My relentless focus on creating impactful marketing strategies that ignite conversations and deliver results has consistently led teams to generate revenue, win awards, and achieve business objectives. With a recent shift to scaling brands, I emphasize sound brand strategy, innovative thinking, and a social-first approach. Five experiences have shaped my approach to brand-building: 1️⃣ Re-invigorating Harley-Davidson: I led a comprehensive change management effort, transforming purpose, products, communications, and engaging the distribution network, with a renewed focus on driving relevancy among a younger audience. The impact of my work is literally showcased in the Harley-Davidson Museum. 2️⃣ Returning Coors Light to growth: Spearheading the #2 beer brand's global repositioning, I drove innovative communications, a social media strategy, revamped packaging, and an ambitious PR-driven approach. Notably, I championed sustainability initiatives, leading the brand's $85M investment to eliminate plastic from all packaging. Efforts led to positive market share growth for the first time in 5 years. 3️⃣ Embedding performance-driven culture: Utilizing attribution technologies, I enabled better effectiveness measurement, leading to increased media investment and calculated risks in social media. At Stix Golf, we achieved a 17% increase in return on ad spend (ROAS) and generated over 275M earned impressions. 4️⃣ Testing and learning with startups: As CMO for a golf startup and consultant for DTC startups, I doubled revenue for Stix Golf and achieved $2M in 48 hours with Bird Buddy. I developed proven strategies for increased ROI and revenue. 5️⃣ Activating at the speed of culture: By embracing calculated risk-taking and social listening, I generated over 20 BILLION earned impressions for the brands I have led.

My goal is always to improve processes and productivity, and I have done that consistently by observing what is and what is not working, asking employees for their opinions, and taking chances to try something different. In many cases, it doesn’t take much effort to create huge results; for example, just changing workflow shaved hours off processing time. Armed with a curious mind and a willingness to step outside the status quo, I employ talents in Lean and Kaizen as well as experience in supply chain management, warehousing, and logistics (including third-party logistics, or 3PL). An adept communicator, I listen to customers’ and employees’ concerns and develop paths toward a solution, gaining consensus with the direction and ensuring goals are reached. I am a talented business leader at the executive level, having worked across several locations, managing P&L and uniting and directing diverse teams.

jerry-fisher-6b233b42,"It is my desire to leave this earth better than I found it, and to help guide as many as I can through and to their meaningful and abundant life. In my book, Will Your Journey Matter, I try and encourage the reader to find their path and walk it slowly, drinking in all that is this life. My invention, Bookie, is designed to foster and improve our ability to learn, to move through this life growing, advancing for these times remain always in us. I wish to understand the motivation, the passion that drives us. My nonprofit organization, Success University Inc., seeks to connect an individual with what they love to do naturally, removing the need for firms to constantly invest in employee motivation campaigns, because when one is performing the work that matches their desire, their core drivers, they no longer need to be motivated, they no longer need constant investment, they are vested because they chose an education and career based on their core mental functions, not because it was trendy, or hot, or because everyone is making money in the field of study. No one ever is completed by money, no one is ever truly happy with money. We are happy because of a feeling that is generated when we are free, when we are at peace, when we can have all that, we desire. Money is a tool to achieve what many desire yes, but we desire what we think we can acquire through money, peace of mind and freedom. I believe it is critical for today's organizations to know why each employee woke and came to work today, and to know it is always something that money cannot buy. When we find the people that are passionate about what we do, all movement is in the same direction. Jim Collins described this as first who, then what and or having the right people on the bus. Hire passion does not resume, first who, then what.

While working within the goals of districts and campuses, I was a self-starter who managed my classroom with high energy, accountability, and creativity. After staying at home, I returned to the workplace as a coordinator of children’s programs for a local church. The program included nearly 500 students, from pre-K through grade 6. I was responsible for planning and designing curriculum, trainings, and parent meetings, organizing schedules leading workshops, retreats, and trainings, and handling all questions, concerns, suggestions, or emergency situations as they arose. I worked remotely, from home, and on-site. I was able to establish a reputation of warm welcoming and caring attention to the students and parents of the community, while growing the program. For seasonal employment, I have used all my skills in previous occupations as a seasonal customer service phone agent for Santa’s Wonderland, the largest Christmas-themed park in Texas. I worked from home, using Zendesk, to take calls from our guests. I answered questions, calmly interacted with guest issues, and projected the philosophy of the business through my role as what is often our guest’s first contact with the park.

sethuiel,"Having completed my undergraduate degree in Social Science Education - History at the University of Georgia, I continued to work as a retail manager for 3 years before starting my teaching career. I taught high school history, geography, and psychology for three years. In 2011 I returned to UGA to attain my masters in historic preservation. My thesis dealt with American policy and the protection of intangible cultural heritage practices. During my second year of graduate school, I start working for Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers in Athens, GA. Within 2 months, I was promoted to Shift Manager. Working hard and developing the crew, I was able to move to Charlottesville, Virginia and take over as Operations Manager. After a year and a half growing the business and increasing the metric in Virginia, I took the opportunity to move to Denver, Colorado to open a new location in a brand new market. Through this new experience I have been able to develop marketing and community contacts in a new environment, hire, train, and develop a brand new staff, and set and maintain the level of excellence of our brand in a new market. My latest move brought me back to Chattanooga. I was hired as the opening general manager for a new Starbucks location in the expanding market. Working there for three years, I overcame challenges like retaining my staff, became the community lead for the district, and grew the business over my time there. In my next step, I have taken on the role of food & beverage supervisor at the Downtown Chattanooga Marriott. In this role, I have opened a new marketplace/coffee shop in the renovated great room, I oversee ordering and inventory for the space and Coke for the entire property, and lead day-to-day business for all food outlets. My latest move has brought me to First Citizens Bank as Sales and Service Representative for a target market. In this move I have found more opportunity and more of a work-life balance as I pursue my goals to enter into talent acquisition, development, and training. Within my first year, I moved up into the role of Operations Services Supervisor where I oversee the SSRs, ensure the branch is up to date on all file work, following regulations, and client satisfaction. In this role, I have hired, trained and developed new members to the banking family. My goal is to move into more of a human resources role. I find the most joy in helping others start their journey within a company. Training, development, teaching, and professional relationship development are all great passions of mine.

fengwei-zhang-profile,"I am actively looking for full-time positions as a Data Scientist or Quant Trader / Researcher after graduating in June. I am currently a master student in UChicago studying Statistics expected to graduate in June. During my education, I become familiar with theories and applications of statistical models in many areas, including time series, stochastic inference, machine learning, etc. I further practiced my skills in my research project, where we developed a new model using large-scale matrix computation to analyze biological big data in a more efficient and accurate way. We derived the statistical method and implemented it in R. I got my bachelor degree in University of Science and Technology of China, where I majored in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics with a focus on Statistics. I interned with Capital Securities Corporation Limited as a Quantitative Research intern. I learned how to apply my skills and knowledges in industry through two projects. The first one is to establish a convertible bond screening model utilizing the B-S option pricing formula and time series analysis, and the second one is to monitor the impact of Covid-19 by analyzing stocks performances related to the pandemic, such as Airplane, Movie, and Game industries.

I collaborate with faculty and staff to realize project goals in the Digital Humanities, student outcomes, and technology integration in the classroom. I graduated from Penn State with a PhD in Spanish and Language Science in 2022. My doctoral research focused on second language acquisition. Specifically, I studied how learners of Spanish utilize their knowledge of word structure (i.e., verb conjugations) to facilitate new verb learning. I am broadly interested in how we as humans detect patterns in language (whether that be listening or reading) and how that helps us learn that language. My expertise lies at the intersection of language acquisition, psycholinguistics, cognitive science, and experimental design and data analysis skills such as self-paced reading, statistical programming in R/R Studio, and data visualization. Other research projects that I have completed examine Spanish and English speech patterns and vowel production from the lenses of sociolinguistics and cognitive psychology. I utilize these skills in project management, data science, and classroom-focused interventions for the benefit of college students in my job every day! Outside of academia, I enjoy spending time in nature, expressive arts, yoga, playing and watching all types of sports, and playing with my cats, Mama and Leda.

My goal is to develop an anti-icing system based on the fabrication of Superhydrophobic surfaces utilizing nano/microstructures and ultrasonic waves. This project has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of aircraft and power generation systems in cold environments. I am also a PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Virginia Tech, with a focus on aero-hydrodynamics and propulsion. I have a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering and a minor in Political Science and International Affairs from the University of Balamand in Lebanon. I aspire to work in the space industry, where I can leverage my engineering skills and political knowledge to create effective solutions for complex challenges. In addition to my academic and research pursuits, I have been involved in various leadership and community activities. As the former chairperson of the ASME UOB Student Chapter, I managed the needs of mechanical engineering students and collaborated with faculty members to provide internships and research opportunities. I also organized and participated in events, trips, and workshops that enhanced the engineering and personal skills of the students. Furthermore, I won a position paper award at the Model Arab League competition, where I represented Oman in the Joint Defense Council and engaged in debates and negotiations on regional issues. I have strong communication, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills, which I have developed and demonstrated through my research, education, and extracurricular activities. I enjoy solving tough logic problems and riddles, discovering new places while hiking or camping with friends, and indulging in some reading and writing. I am open to adapt to any situation and am looking for a job/internship that can have a positive impact on the community and individuals.

noel-sabiston-3450659,"I started in the Campus Card System world in 1990 and have seen it grow and I grew with it. Starting with Griffin Technology, the first Campus Card company in the Higher Ed market as a service technician. Diebold bought Griffin in the late 90's and I moved into sale shortly after that. As a Sales Account Manager I brought my technical background and deeper underling of how the products worked to the customers and I could answer the tough questions on the spot. I give great advice of how to grown their system and make this growth painless. Being a tech first I have worked on many accounts on the east coast and built a relationship that carried over into my sales that I still have today. When Cbord bought the Card System group from Diebold in Aug 2005 I moved the Higher Ed side. Working here at Florida Tech for over 15 years I see many things a Sales Account Manager misses in trying to help any University build a better system. I work to improve our system everyday.

Possible responses to climate change include the acclimation and adaptation capabilities of plankton as well as movement along their environmental niches. Plankton communities are composed of a myriad of microscopic organisms with various sizes ranging from viruses (0-0.2 μm), bacteria (0.2-3 μm), single celled protists (1-200 μm) to small metazoans (20-2000 μm).

ryan-cattell,"Since I was young I have always been known for having a strong work ethic, competitive drive with high energy and a positive mindset when faced with challenges. I started learning about leadership at a very young age when I was exposed to multiple coaches/mentors within the sports I played. Over the span of 25 years these coaches, both good and bad, helped develop the way I lead to this day. I was able to travel the country and meet/work with individuals from all walks of life. I quickly understood that there are a lot of different roads to the same destination and we can learn from each other's life experiences to build a stronger connection as a team. in 2002, I was able to put my leadership skills to the test in a business setting for the first time. I opened and led my first business-to-business sales company where I hired, developed, motivated and trained reps to become business owners of their own. Within 7 years our team went from one office in Minneapolis to 6 locations in 3 different states. We created a culture of care and team work that helped support and motivate the entire sales crew through servant leadership and most importantly learn to lead by example. In 2008 I got married and decided to take my leadership style to the corporate world and see if servant leadership and an entrepreneur mindset would be successful. Over the past 14 years, I have helped grow a small private nursing school with a few hundred students to the largest nursing college in the country. I facilitate teams and coach professionals to provide value to customers by embracing Agility and seeking to continuously improve daily through constant communication. I have come to understand that having a student approach to life/business is the key to future growth and high performing individuals/teams. With that being said I decided to also go back and complete my BA and Masters degree in project management and Agile Certificates. In addition to my professional career I also coach and develop our youth in sports and understand how important the Agile mindset is to becoming successful. I am passionate about helping others understand the power of a positive attitude and leading with humility and empathy towards others. Over the past 10 years I have helped over 30 athletes reach their goal of playing a college sport by setting them up with a strong mental game and work ethic that is second to none. Please feel free to reach out to me if there is any value i can provide you or your organization.

emmanuel-eni-b77376107,"Nowadays, technology has never been more relevant in the teaching and learning of science. The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework proposed by Mishra and Koehler, in my humble opinion, upholds modern science education. The modern science teacher must hareness the power of modern technology (technological knowledge) to channel the subject matter (content knowledge) in a form which facilitates teaching and learning of science (pedagogical knowledge). The concepts of science vary indiscriminately from obvious to subtle to counterintuitive. Technology can help and does help make the counterintuitive obvious. Moreover, the ubiquitousness of the computer as a tool in modern fields of professional science practice further necessitates for today's science learner an early familiarity with the computer as a tool of learning and practicing science. Even as the major fields of science develop computational outcrops which are rapidly becoming science disciplines in their own right, such as computational chemistry. Therefore, technology in the science classroom does not only enhance science teaching and learning, it also prepares the modern learner for the modern world. This is my passion, to device ways in which technology can enhance my teaching of chemistry and facilitate the learning of chemistry by my students. There has never been a better time to be a chemistry teacher!

shernice-johnson-4b01a4a8,"Hello! My name is Shernice Johnson. I am a Distinguished math teacher, currently looking to obtain a job as an elementary math dean, math consultant or a curriculum planner for elementary math. I have been teaching for eight years within a Charter school setting. I am certified NYS teacher for grades 1-6. For three consecutive years 92% of my kids were proficient on the NYS 4th grade Math exam. I believe in the growth mindset; mistakes are proof that you are trying and learning. I believe that feedback is a gift and without feedback a person can become stagnated. 28% of females are currently working in the STEM field, out of 28% only 4% of those jobs are taken by African Americans. This is a problem that only we can fix. I want to be the change that people need to see within the STEM field. I adore teaching Math to kids. I never want to hear any of my students state “I am not a math person” I want my students to know that they can accomplish any and everything they set their minds to. You must meet a child where they are, to fully understand the whole child. You must listen to understand and not to respond. A child is a human. For a child to feel comfortable, safe, and successful, you must understand and teach the whole child not only the academics. Every child has capability to learn. It is our job as teachers to meet each child where they are. It takes big hearts to help shape little minds but is also takes little minds to help shape a big heart. I am confident that I can grow and become a terrific math dean, curriculum planner or math consultant.

valentin-gulyas,"I’m an early member of Firework–now the largest privately owned video commerce player in the world that raised $235M from prominent VCs. I was lucky to have the founding members mentor me, which resulted in me (i) leading 3 departments, (ii) receiving an MBA à la Firework, (iii) accept 2 annual peer-nominated awards, and (iv) changing the course of my life. I loved working for a startup, but my childhood dream was to study psychology. So, I left Firework to begin a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Biological Science (Psychology) at the University of Cambridge. The MPhil is a postgraduate research degree that allowed me to learn how to conduct research at a high level. At Cambridge, I conducted an independent research study that focused on exploring potential cognitive predictors of high mathematical expertise under the Centre for Neuroscience in Education lab. Although the MPhil was an intensive program, I continuously found myself spending my free time reading VC blogs, building decks for large companies on how to explore emerging businesses (e.g., Netflix, Meta, Spotify), and dabbling with my own companies (e.g., HR software, content software, lead gen). Neither my decks nor my dabbling amounted to much. However, they kept me curious about ways to grow businesses. As a result, I realized that whatever I naturally spend my free time on is something I should work with. I’ve now graduated and I’m therefore searching for a venture that allows me to work on growing a startup or an emerging business at a large company. I would find the most value in working for a company that I can provide value for while learning from others.

william-bryan-3b965091,"I am writer and editor supporting NASA's Space Launch System Program at Marshall Space Flight Center. I get to work with the team that is building this incredibly powerful rocket that will return humans to the Moon and be the backbone for space exploration for decades to come. For the last six years, I was a web editor and senior writer for NASA. In short, I helped tell NASA's story by writing content for and helping maintain NASA's web presence. As a writer, I am living out a long-time dream of writing for the agency. I am fortunate to have worked at the University of Arkansas's Office of University Relations as a part-time science writer. The experience, completed while working on my Master's degree in space and planetary sciences, was invaluable, as the members of the team taught me how to be a professional science writer. Prior to becoming a part of the chief technologist's team, I worked as a part-time technical editor in support of the document preparation for the critical design review for NASA's next rocket, the Space Launch System. I worked with an incredible team while being able to do my small part to help get rocket that will send humans to Mars ready for its review. Before, during, and after my time as technical editor, I had the blessing of being a crew trainer Space Camp at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center. During my 15 months there, I was blessed to teach, guide, and inspire over 1,000 trainees of all ages through the story of the space program. Many of those I taught want to become astronauts, and I am extremely confident they will. I am blessed every day to have a job a love; a job that allows me to tell the vastly complex and intriguing story of the space program.

leoprosso,"At International Scientific Technologies I have had the privilege of working on projects for NASA's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. Here I performed R&D for radiation resistant polymers for deployment on NASA's Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) and radiation resistant polymer-regolith composites for the use in Martian and Lunar habitats. My duties involved polymer synthesis and characterization as well as report writing and the use of OLTARIS to simulate the effect of Galactic Cosmic Rays on materials whether in free space or on Martian and Lunar surfaces. Working at International Scientific Technologies has furthered my passion towards polymers and material engineering, and upon graduation I hope to further my experience in the R&D field.

adam-smith-b9248044,"I have always been fascinated with how things work. When I was young, I would break open junk electronics and tinker with the parts inside trying to figure out what went wrong and trying desperately to fix it. This was the beginning of my lifelong obsession with technical troubleshooting. In my formative youth I studied hard and became fluent in many programming languages and web design techniques but soon that wasn't enough. I moved on and dived in to networking. I read everything I could get my hands on, and built home labs to experiment and see it all in action. By the time I was ready to launch a career, I had the knowledge and the ability to apply it. I had forged myself into exactly the kind of technician I wanted to be. Information technology is not only my passion, but it is in my blood. Today I am a sought out commodity because my passion is palpable, and as evidence I have worked for some of the greatest technological companies in the world.

And look I did, saving the hospital >30% of their quality control budget.

charles-wolstenholme,"I have my PhD in Chemistry from Pennsylvania State University. I am a highly-motivated individual whose practical scientific problem-solving skills and experience will allow me to immediately contribute to scientific research at Merck. Penn State’s Graduate Chemistry Department has exposed me to numerous resources, accelerated coursework and cutting-edge research allowing me to develop a diverse skill set. The focus of my graduate research for Dr. Xin Zhang has been the development of small-molecule probes based off of fluorescent protein chromophores to visualize previously undetectable biological pathways. While performing this research, I mastered the skills necessary to lead projects from initial probe design and synthesis to final imaging and application in mammalian cells. Prior to Penn State, I interned with Dr. Derek Lowe at Vertex Pharmaceuticals developing a novel approach to determine drug analytes crystal structures through non-covalent interactions with metal organic frameworks. Additionally, as an Undergraduate Research Fellow at Boston College in Dr. Jefferey Byers lab, I gained significant experience in catalyst design and synthesis. Overall, I believe my extensive research experience and expertise reflects my ability to effectively transition into active projects, make significant contributions, and excel in an industry setting. As a graduate student at Penn State, I have taken on many leadership roles apart from my scientific research field. I was recently nominated and elected to be a Graduate Student Advocate, acting as an ombudsman to lead conflict resolution meetings between graduate students, professors and department staff. Also, as an active member of the Graduate and Professional Student Association, I have become the head of a central committee, managing groups of graduate students to organize and put on events for the betterment of graduate life here at Penn State.

eric-lyde-chb-cscp-9343692,"✦ Summary ✦ I am a seasoned leader with a long history of success in logistics and supply chain leadership, as well as a breadth and depth of experience not often matched in the logistics field. Especially noteworthy is my talent for building and optimizing logistics networks; leveraging this skill set, I’ve been instrumental in leading my employers through unprecedented challenges like those supply chain and logistics companies have faced since 2020. Over the course of my 20+ year career, I’ve consistently negotiated complex transportation contracts while implementing best practices and technologies and driving network optimization, resulting in significantly reduced operating costs, increased productivity, and improved delivery performance. At Ball Corporation, where I’ve served for the past 5 years, my role has continually evolved as needs are revealed. I was brought on board initially to mentor high-potential leaders and provide expertise and experience to the Logistics Procurement team. Shortly thereafter, I stepped into greater authority and oversight, taking on Project Logistics in 2019, the Warehousing team in 2020 and the Real Estate team in 2021. I currently operate in a director-equivalent capacity, driving strategy and spearheading continual efforts to transform the logistics network. Previously, as the Logistics & Supply Chain Director / Senior Manager at Brocade, directed hundreds of special projects to drive continuous improvement in the global supply chain. Additionally, early roles with Quantum Logistics, Eagle Logistics, and Adcom Worldwide afforded me a strong foundation in the field and a deep understanding of 3PL, carrier and freight forwarder operations. Over the years, I’ve demonstrated a keen talent for partnering with cross-functional stakeholders and executive leadership in delivering strategic policies, processes, procedures, and tools to position the logistics organization as a balanced, efficient, cost-effective, and service-oriented function. On the people leadership front, I have a proven history of building, training, motivating, and retaining high-performing teams at every level. My teams rank consistently among the top performers organization-wide. ✦ Areas of Expertise ✦ Third-Party Logistics • Warehousing • Supply Chain & Inventory Management • Domestic & International Operations • Supply Chain Leadership • Project Management • Supplier Relationship Management • Risk Management • Continuous Improvement • Contract Negotiations • Trade & Customs Compliance • Import / Export Regulations • Team Building

billmosakowski,"In December 1986, I made a life-changing decision. I got up, put on a suit and tie, walked downstairs to a desk right off of my living room and started a company to serve health and human services agencies through strong relationships and sound guidance to improve their financial and operational performance. I did this because I believe that when the public sector provides its best service, lives can be changed for the better. This adventure sparked an unfailing curiosity about the complex problems faced by people in our communities and a relentless desire to be part of the solution. Since its inauspicious start, that company – Public Consulting Group – has grown into a leading consulting, management services and technology firm that has served all fifty states, hundreds of large municipalities, and the federal government and many of its territories, under seven presidents and hundreds of governors. Today, we are a dynamic, diverse team of 3,000 employees who are passionate about helping the public sector improve lives. We live by the values of Entrepreneurial Spirit, Passion for public service, Impact in our work, and Community service on a global scale. Many believe that a person’s success can be measured by the obstacles they personally overcame. At PCG, we measure success in the obstacles we help others to overcome. Improving lives in this way was the North Star that guided my decision 36 years ago and remains a daily commitment I strive to honor as a business leader, a trusted advisor to public sector agencies, and an active, contributing member of my local and global communities. Note: I try to respond to all messages, but am not interested in solicitations on LinkedIn.

We really need to implement a last-second promotion and boost sales? Totally. Let’s do it. Deadlines are creeping up and we really need to get different assets finalized? I will work on it RIGHT NOW. Dwelling on bad news that disrupt your daily workflow process never solves anything. You still have to do your job, and do it the best you possibly can. Again, say it with me - BE. A. PROBLEM. SOLVER!

After being successful in design for ten wonderful years, it was time to take a different path in my career. This was a change that would make me more well-rounded in digital marketing, instead of only being known as a design specialist. When I am not busy crushing it in the marketing realm, I’m usually out with my friends and family, playing in softball, volleyball, or pool leagues, sampling a beverage, or staying in and getting cozy with my fiancé with a TV series on Netflix.

Unfortunately, some couples are denied this opportunity due to conflicting genetics. Treatments for the once thought incurable genetic diseases have greatly piqued my interest, though application in utero has remained untouched. I wish to dedicate my life to researching developmental genetic therapies that will enable everyone who wishes to experience the miracle of a healthy childbirth regardless of their genetic disposition. My path towards a career in developmental genetics led to pursuing a BS in Genetics, Genomics & Biotechnology at Brigham Young University. My part-time work to finance college consisted of multiple supervisory positions that gave me experience as a leader. Eventually I entered into a lab at BYU that focused heavily on redox developmental biology. The greatest accomplishments during my undergraduate science career was achieving authorship on a paper and winning the Life Sciences College Undergraduate Research Award, which provided me with a grant to pursue my own research project. My time in the lab has taught me many skills useful for the field of genetics research such as: ▪ Maintaining cell cultures ▪ Performing BCA assays for standardization purposes ▪ Running Southern blots for measuring DNA differences between gene edited strands ▪ Knocking down genes using transfection

This background prepared me well for many roles throughout my career where I have utilized both sides of my brain to see dreams come to fruition and lives changed as a result. While working with Cru, I honed my communication skills by writing and speaking regularly. I built relationships with donors, raised funds, and developed graphic design and storytelling skills to produce needed marketing and communications pieces. I then enhanced and leveraged these skills in my partnerships with both Florida Abolitionist and Nathaniel's Hope making a lasting impact in our community. Now, I rely on these abilities heavily in customer success. I am committed to giving my customers the service they deserve so they can achieve success. I have a reputation for being honest and fair and will go above and beyond so that each customer's goals are reached. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family.

lance-butcher-8398a6117,"""Sic parvis magna."" It's Latin for ""greatness from small beginnings"". It's my favorite motto because of it's application to my life, that in order to get to where you're going, we all have to start somewhere. I've heard that communication is one of the most important skills to master. It's the building block of all things meaningful. Throughout my life, I've had many opportunities to hone my communication skills; take my jobs, for instance. Sure, a golf course job and a grocery store don't sound super fancy, but greatness often starts from humble beginnings. Being told you've made someone's day or having an old timer tell you that ""you're like a grandson to me"" or that ""you'll accomplish many things in life if you keep this outlook on life"" or that when an angry customer forgets why they're angry after talking with you, those definitely make my day, as well. ""Greatness"" also comes from overcoming challenges and becoming more efficient at what one does. In my time as a pharmacy technician (now over 7 years), I've learned so much in that time, and the best part is that there is so much more to learn. It's something that gives me perspective, and despite having difficulties figuring out what I've wanted to do for a career for much of my life, this definitely gives me stability and hope that this is something I can make into a career. My recent admission into the University of Florida college of pharmacy reaffirms that I'm willing to take on greater challenges, expand my knowledge base and meet new people so I can contribute at a higher level. So if you want to communicate about anything medical-based, digital media, music (I play guitar and piano, by the way), sports, travelling, or ""greatness"", send me an email at sirlancealot325@gmail.com

I would like to work with a company who provides assistance to those in the community. In the mean time, I have been volunteering, interning, and mentoring. Throughout high school I volunteered at Doylestown Health (the local hospital), Doylestown Food Pantry (the local food pantry), and Code Blue Shelter (an organization that shelters the homeless on nights where it gets too cold). I also volunteer at local food pantry in my area today as well called Our Lady's Pantry. Over time I have accumulated more than 600+ community service hours. In college, I interned at Home Again St Johns, an organization which provided services for the homeless during the day. When the internship was over, I continued to volunteer my time there. I also took up academic mentoring at USF. I mentored a student with intellectual disabilities by helping him with homework and other school related projects. It was extremely rewarding and we even built a friendship out of it. I really enjoy to help people! It is in my nature. But I do not just want to stop there. I want to give the people I am helping a voice. I really want to make a difference in their lives and in the community.

sophia-escalante-9b6aa41ab,"Understanding that the self is a book filled with empty pages is paramount to continuing education and expanding your horizons. There is always a challenge in writing on a blank page; the anxiety of writing something wrong, or wild inaccurate about the self. However, the pages are not finite - there are infinite possibilities of the self, and how we evolve from the beginning pages to now and then the future goes to show how, as humans, we are resilient, fluid, and eager to build our better selves. I am young, and have made many changes to my aspirations over the years. First, before my Bachelor’s, I wanted to be a culinary chef specialising in baking. As I grew to love culinary, psychology appealed to me, and I pursued it to the fullest extent, with the goal to become a Mental Health Counsellor. In a book, the main character may go on many adventures, ones we may not expect them to do. In my RMHC program, I had discovered a whole section of work that immediately caught my interest: Disability Studies. Working with students with disabilities and co-existing with my own made the urge to learn about it had filled several pages of my book, and I took the chance with my background in Disability studies and Disability Rights to move into Women’s and Gender Studies, as I sought to learn everything there is to know in the world of Disability. I have spent my current time working alongside people with disabilities, attending awareness trainings, researching, collaborating, educating myself from all aspects and educating others who may be unaware of the history of Disabilities in society, like sexuality, crime, and law. This isn’t just a “in school” passion for disability studies - this is an active facet of my life, listening to disability advocates and activists, reading literature, reading blogs, learning the laws, and the disparities and issues left out of the limelight. I aim to enter into Higher Education in order to amplify voices that otherwise are ignored, as well as give a fresh perspective to those who may be unaware. Life is a book after all - new pages to write in with new knowledge. I am always open to new research possibilities and topics, so if you have book, blog, or article recommendations, let’s get in touch!

calvin-g-ludwig,"After being born and raised in Poughkeepsie, NY, and attending local public schools, I attended Williams College (Williamstown, MA) and graduated in 2018 with Honors, Magna Cum Laude, and Phi Beta Kappa with a double major in mathematics and biology. I worked for one year in the Zon Lab at Boston Children's Hospital Dept. of Stem Cell Biology as a bioinformatics analyst. In 2019, I began pursuing an M.D. at Tufts University School of Medicine (Boston, MA). When I graduated in 2023, I was the first doctor in my family. At Tufts, I performed computational research in the Computational Hemodynamics Laboratory with PI Adel Malek MD/PhD in the Dept. of Neurosurgery at Tufts Medical Center. My work is focused on the application of Radiomics computational feature extraction for the prediction of intracranial aneurysm rupture. I published a first-author paper (PMID: 33158993) as well as two other co-authored papers in peer-reviewed science journals. Throughout my medical education, I quickly became interested in internal medicine as the way in which I envision myself practicing medicine. In March 2023, I was matched to Tufts Medical Center's internal medicine residency program, which began in June 2023. Since age 10, I have played flute and piccolo, playing in the Berkshire Symphony Orchestra at Williams College and currently the Longwood Symphony Orchestra in Boston. In 2018, I won the Berkshire Symphony Soloist Competition (https://youtu.be/KJYkArnNKvo) and in 2021, I won the $15,000/yr Joseph Collins Foundation Scholarship for medical students in music and the arts.

As a former collegiate tennis player, I didn’t think I’d ever consider playing a game with a plastic whiffle ball, but in 2019, I fell deeply in love with the growing sport of pickleball! I was delighted by the people I met, the playful banter, and the fact that I could play for hours and completely lose track of time. I became a pro-certified pickleball instructor and nothing brings me greater joy than helping others discover and grow their game. Business, education, and athletics have been intertwined throughout my life and career. I’ve held a wide range of jobs including action sports sales representative, high school business and marketing teacher, marketing editor-in-chief at a software startup, Amazon content specialist, tennis instructor, and mother of two. Whoever said “Life is one big adventure or nothing” is spot on. Getting out of your comfort zone is essential for growth and I’ve done that by traveling to 16 different countries (lived in three). I’ve been skydiving, bungee jumping, scuba diving, white and black water rafting, sledging, swimming with manta rays, sheered sheep, and been followed by the KGB in Russia… learned to kiteboard, surf, speak Spanish, belly dance, play pádel, and breastfeed a baby while folding laundry and being on a conference call. It’s amazing what we can do when we approach life enthusiastically with an open mind. Launching my own business has always been a dream and I’m so excited to begin this new adventurous chapter of my life.

cherokee-huff-peete-8513a81b9,"I am a recent graduate of Lincoln University earning my Bachelor of Science in Business Management. Despite having left school only just a year ago, I bring 3+ years of work experience to the table. I simultaneously studied and worked remotely for the company Reed Technology as a data entry specialist for two years. During that time I was able to develop the self-management skills required to work in a remote environment and an understanding of data processing applications. After earning my degree I pursued a new opportunity at Constellation (previously known as Exelon). I initially entered the company through their Leadership Development Program, a rotational program designed to teach high-level professional skills through exposure to different teams and specialized responsibilities. Unfortunately, due to unforseen circumstances, the program was dissolved before I could explore all avenues within it, but I was offered the opportunity to remain with the company on their Power Accounting team. The Leadership Development program has given me the opportunity to hone a wide variety of skills such as accounting, invoicing and vouchering, administrative skills, knowledge of high-level data analyzing tools, and more. Most importantly, my time at Constellation has solidified my confidence in myself as a professional. Starting remotely at a new company with a reputation like Constellation's immediately after college and during a global pandemic made me feel incredibly nervous. Today I can say for certain that I possess valuable skills, I am capable of adapting to difficult situations, and I can be an asset to any team.

kristyn-kelly-shapiro-06354a210,"An email announcing a job that paid $11 an hour changed the course of my professional career. I started my career in national security somewhat on a whim. While studying abroad I received an email about an internship in the Office of Naval Intelligence. I knew nothing about it, but that it would pay $11 an hour which seemed like a mint so I took a leap of faith that set me on my amazing journey! My career at ONI and on the N2 staff truly laid the foundation for who I am as a professional today. Always comfortable with public speaking, military culture helped me up my game both in terms of slide deck creation and briefing style. I am still heard to this day quoting an Admiral who said, ""no more than three lines per slide, no more than five words per line or vice versa."" I was the beneficiary of mentors who helped push me to challenge myself whether serving as an EA in the Pentagon or pursuing an MBA despite my “non-traditional” background. I cannot underscore enough the value and impact of mentorship both as a mentee and mentor. Grad school pushed me out of my comfort zone more so than anything I’ve done except maybe becoming a parent! Through the experience I honed in on who I was as a person, a professional, and a leader most notably realizing that the only way I could be was authentically honest and genuine. The FBI is where I developed as a leader and realized my passion for business process improvement and crisis communications. The opportunities to take on big organizational challenges and apply business best practices were endless. Leading through multiple crises from the longest shutdown in government history to the pandemic to the events of January 6th, highlighted my skill in and passion for bringing organization to chaos, and effectively communicating in a straightforward and genuine manner. I now find myself in the midst of my next leap of faith having just joined the private sector! What was so appealing about Guidehouse is that it’s a firm that allows me to bring my “whole self” to work. By that I mean it provides me with the opportunity to continue to help business process improve defense and security agencies, for mentorship via an amazing network of “former feds”, to stretch and grow in the “unknown”, and have the flexibility I need as the mom of a one- and three-year-old. If you are passionate about national security, want to nerd out on how to make the federal government operate efficiently and effectively, or need help thinking through how to communicate through a crisis CONNECT WITH ME ON LINKEDIN!

eric-lake-phd-a9559b149,"“Structure determines function.” A simple phrase that describes a central biological concept. In deference to this mantra, the overarching goal of my research career is to dissect how structural movements of proteins modulate function, and to apply this understanding to improving therapeutics for treatment of human disease. My unique background, which combines industrial training in protein purification and molecular biology with graduate training in cutting-edge biophysical techniques, has given me the tools necessary to understand proteins as living, “breathing” molecules, with dynamic structural movements that drive their function. As a graduate student, I have contributed insight into how the structure of protein kinases, a key class of signaling enzymes implicated in many cancers, is influenced by drug binding and how the kinase activation state alters drug binding. The results of my studies directly apply to the selectivity of inhibitors currently in clinical development and suggest potential uses for these inhibitors in treatment of human cancers involving the Aurora kinases. Importantly, the methodology that I co-developed can be applied to other clinically-relevant kinases and has broad implications for the rational design of improved kinase inhibitors that exploit structural dynamics to gain selectivity.

john-judis,"I started my work experience at the age of 15 at Dairy Queen and was promoted to Assistant Manager after just two years. I was able to improve customer service, train new employees, and track inventory. In this position, I assisted in day-to-day operations for a large corporation at such an early stage of my professional career. In addition to my managing experience, I was also a server at Romano Mercato Inc. This experience emphasized the value of efficient teamwork within a workplace. My job required me to maintain the cleanliness of tables, provide excellent customer service to customers, and retain menu items and descriptions to ensure the best quality service. Both of these job experiences emphasized the importance of efficiency and problem solving within a company. Today as a student at Indiana University, I am involved heavily within my fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi. As Social Media Chair, member of the Standards Board, and member of the Philanthropy Committee, I am faced with challenges in many aspects and do my part in solving these problems.

Having painting parties when someone in the group is feeling a change and wants to do some home improvement projects (which in most cases that someone is normally me). I am a professional! After high school I was still a bit indecisive of what it was exactly what I wanted to do with my career. The only thing that I did know is that I wanted to help people and make a difference! After being in management for 10 years I grew a passion for people and building relationships, understanding their strengths and placing them where they could grow and be most successful, from this passion I realized I was born to be a Recruiter! After getting my first recruiting position I felt the thrill of being apart of changing lives by finding that great position to positively impact people's lively hood to create a better life for themselves and their families. I realized this is where I want to be and where I want to continue going.

In a previous life, I was an early product and leader that started the growth teams at Robinhood, Coinbase, and HealthTap pre-IPO. I helped to accelerate Robinhood’s user base from 6 million to 10 million users thanks to building out the ""invite your friends"" referrals program (""accounted for over 80% of new users at the time of IPO"") and starting initiatives like Robinhood Learn (learn.robinhood.com).

auston-viotto-2557b8107,"I am a passionately curious and self-motivated individual who loves learning and working on a multitude of different problems. I initially became interested in engineering during high school. Picking up old CRT television sets from the roadside and rewiring them to work as cheap oscilloscopes or converting a car alternator into a motor for an air-raid siren. I enjoy learning how things work, as well as innovating and inventing new ideas. This experience led me to enroll in a mechanical engineering program to understand more about the technology that is driving our world. I later became interested in holograms like the ones in Star Wars which led me to take initiative my freshman year of college to design and build a system that would be able to produce such holograms. I became interested in research as a freshman after I gained some help from a couple of professors to get my project off the ground. I enjoyed the work I was able to do. My experience with my first project, an examination into Rayleigh scattering to produce holographic 3D images, led to other research endeavors on topics including research into new electro-optical systems and finally the imaging of microscopic/ nanoscopic boiling and heat phenomena on functionalized metallic surfaces. Currently, I have presented two of my projects at conferences, both locally in Nebraska and across the country, including Nebraska Academy of Sciences and Out 4 Undergraduate Engineering Conferences just to name a few. The relevance of the latter project aligns with NASA’s technical area dealing with thermal management systems and has piqued my interest in the field of thermal and fluid flow sciences. As an undergraduate, I have learned how important it is to work closely with other experienced engineers, and faculty related to my field. My dream is to be a part of a hardworking and dedicated team pushing the envelope of science and technology and to apply my skills to make a positive impact within the aerospace industry. I firmly believe that engineering requires you to be a lifelong learner. My undergraduate experiences have inspired me to continue my education into graduate school, so I can further my research and make meaningful contributions to the aerospace community.

eleanor-dunning-531715220,"I interned with the Lake Cunningham Development Trust (a non-profit park project) this summer. I learned about donor outreach, the fundamentals of public affairs and marketing (relating to non-profit organizations), and park operations. This summer was an opportunity to advocate for Nebraska tourism through social media management, photography, promotional development, and park project management. Since returning to school, I've been meeting with foundation leaders to expand my understanding of grant writing and donor relationship facilitation. In the Summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to intern for the Honorable Congressman Don Bacon in Washington, D.C. For six weeks, I responded to constituent needs, gave tours of the U.S. Capitol, and shadowed the Congressman’s Legislative Assistants. I joined the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Residential Assistant (RA) team in January of 2023. As a team, we facilitate programming to encourage lasting connections between residents. As an RA, I teach my residents to form lasting relationships. I collaborate with another teammate to foster a healthy environment for the 100+ students on our dorm floor. About 90% of our residents are freshmen looking to establish a community at a large university. I meet with my residents throughout the year, facilitate roommate conflict resolution and design graphics for student resource opportunities using Canva and Adobe Illustrator. I have an incredible supervisor and am fortunate to work with 12 other staff members in my building.

mikebhedgepethobx,"I am a ""Jack-of-all-Trades"" -- having run the gamut of golf course landscaping and groundskeeping in my early years, to drawing and design, retail, insurance, and merchandising. In anything I do, however, I am a hardworking, diligent, efficient, and committed individual. I work easily with others or on my own. I am very malleable, with the ability to pick up new skills and adapt quickly. I graduated with my BFA from Old Dominion University in 2010 where I quickly applied for dozens of graphic design and art related jobs, but was unfortunately unable to acquire. This ultimately led me to working for GEICO, starting a career as a licensed insurance agent that spanned over a decade, having been licensed in 47 different states and working with multiple products including but not limited to auto, boat, motorcycle, ATV/UTV, antique auto, recreational vehicle, home/dwelling, renters, homeowners wind & hail, and flood insurance. Working part time while employed at Outer Banks Insurance Agency, I took a full-time position as a merchandiser for Coca-Cola Consolidated. I am extremely personable and easy to talk to/with, and am extremely successful at building rapport with clients. I'm quick to learn systems and software, and even wrote a training manual for the third-party proprietary systems used within our office at Outer Banks Insurance Agency for new employees to assist in navigating and utilizing these applications quickly and efficiently. I am self-motivated and push myself to achieve my best, having been one of the top service agents within my department at GEICO and cross-trained to not only assist current policyholders with their insurance issues but also assist the Emergency Road Service department with roadside assistance calls at the same time. My freelance illustration and design work has been predominantly commission artwork and logo design, where I work closely with the client to ensure their intended message and emotion grabs the viewer -- whether this is a sentimental ballpoint pen drawing of a childhood home full of fond moments and memories, a fun-loving t-shirt design for a small town seafood company, or a professional logo for an up-and-coming house-flipping business. Due to customers primarily being located up and down the East Coast, most communication is handled through email and responded to promptly, with the finished product being submitted for approval and finalization quickly.

nikki-adamson-050a4a2a,"👋🏽 I’m Nikki (she/her) and I’m an entrepreneur, recruiter, competitor, equity advocate and mom. I currently run Hustle Hunters, a recruiting firm that has helped over 15 startups hire early team members with an equity-centered approach to building the right hiring foundation and building trust within historically excluded candidate communities. In addition to working with our great team and partners, biking around my new hometown (Portland, OR), telling jokes, traveling (I’ve been to 5 continents so far) chilling with my husband and daughter, playing board games, watching sports (born/bread fan ofNew England teams) and quoting The Office are some of my favorite activities. After running YMCA youth sports and PE programs, my early stage startup sales career started at Chute where I closed over $1.75M in business with over 120 customers, and notably led the business and product in a pivot towards a new vertical based on customer insights and industry expertise. The nimbleness, energy and innovation of the startup industry captured her imagination as a breeding ground for early adoption and social enterprise. After the birth of my daughter Izzy, I joined Milk Stork in sales + partnerships in a role that exposed me to many moms with stories of their struggles balancing doing big work in the midst of motherhood. In addition to bringing on new clients, partners, and helping transition towards a recurring revenue model, I was able to work closely with Kate Torgerson (CEO) and learn directly how to build an industry disrupting startup while also supporting a traditionally marginalized employee group of caregivers. In building Hustle Hunters over the past 3 years, I’ve diligently created an environment for all employees to thrive and connect as humans with each other, clients and the candidates they work with. Removing barriers and setting others up to thrive has been a theme throughout both my career and personal life - and is currently manifested in my work within the talent acquisition space. As collegiate basketball player, I’ve always loved a good flare screen, and see this current TA work as a blend of my competitive work ethic and strategic pursuit of more equitable access to opportunity by removing systemic barriers in the tech industry. The approach has taken time, learning, listening, unlearning, laughter and humility - but has been a critical part of creating the future workspaces I envisioned. You can find me on Storygraph (23nikki23) or at my local library checking out way too many books (recent favorites: The Wake Up, True Biz, Nightcrawling).

xijie-qin-219a6896,"In general, I am interested in turbulence and transport physics in core and edge regions of tokamak plasmas. I am familiar with the development of fluctuation diagnostics such as optical spectroscopy and microwave diagnostics. I am also interested in and would like to explore more about theoretical models and simulations such as TGLF and C-GYRO. The following research topics are of special interest. • Rotation shear significantly suppress turbulence and turbulent transport, which is essential for tokamak confinement. With external injected torque being less effective for future large-size tokamaks, understanding the generation of intrinsic rotation becomes more important. • The performance of tokamaks is greatly enhanced when the operational regime enters H-mode (high-confinement). Understanding the physics governing the L-H transition and being able to predict the L-H transition power threshold is essential for tokamak operation. • Edge localized modes (ELMs) present at H-mode plasmas and release bursts of pedestal energy, which could damage fusion devices and reduce their lifetime. The wide pedestal Quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) is a ELM-stable high performance operation mode achieved at low rotation. It is proposed that the enhanced edge turbulence-driven transport regulates the pedestal gradients and ceases the edge MHD modes. I-mode is also a ELM-free operation regime with high energy confinement and low particle confinement achieved by operating in the unfavorable configuration. Understanding the physics governing those operational regimes is important to improve the tokamak performance. • The changes in plasma shape both impact equilibrium and turbulence. The research about negative triangularity reveals many benefits in terms of stabilizingMHDmodes and reducing turbulent transport. Optimizing the plasma shape and magnetic configuration is an essential step toward fusion power plant.

bethany-snortum-6a68a611b,"I took a field course class last summer that required travelling to remote landscapes and camping for many days at a time. The main focus was to observe nature, specifically insect ecology, and record those observations. This gave me a very fine set of skills, such as making my own observations and conclusions in the field, following those observations with database research, and communicating those ideas with others. Another skill I gained from this experience is simply appreciating whatever nature tries to throw at me. I even appreciated the occasional downpours, as they cooled me off and washed away lingering dirt. The last two semesters I have been working on an independent research project with a graduate student that has truly tested my research and developmental skills. I am now capable of writing a literature review, reaching out to other faculty for resources to run a successful experiment, and selecting significant points of data to find interesting and accurate results. I have taken quite a few taxonomy courses that have allowed me to practice with keys and identify many native insects.

I am wonderful at solving disputes, reaching a desired middle ground for two or more parties. My excellent communication skills help me achieve this; I grew up with five siblings, so I had to learn how to interact with many different people. When I was just starting my second job as a Team Member at a Firehouse Subs, I had just completed my training when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States. Suddenly, there were many changes in the workplace and in society. I was well-equipped to handle these challenges, communicating with my workplace to adhere to new guidelines. Thrown off balance, I quickly recovered and was able to adapt to all circumstances because I was willing to learn. My flexibility will be vital as a programmer, and I am constantly working on my own projects to enhance my skills.
